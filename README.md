# Data Visualization Courses

This repo contains jupyter notebooks with the code of two Data Visualization Courses.


#### Coursera Applied Plotting
   url => https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting
   A course about matplotlib and the various types of charts that are available in the matplotlib framework
   
#### Kaggle - Data Visualization
  url => https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization
  A course that overviews the most common charts using the Seaborn package


#### Exploratory Data Analysis
      Steps:
         1. Identification of variables, data types and shape of the dataset
            - Numerical => Discrete or Continuous
            - Categorical => Ordinal or Nominal
         2. Analyzins basic metrics => Statistical Summary
         3. Non-Graphical Univariate Analysis
            - Get the count and list of unique values
            - Filtering based on coditions + grouping
         4. Graphical Univariate Analysis
            - Analyzing individual feature patterns using visualization
            - Histograms (numeric features), box plots (categorical features), count plots
         5. Bivariate Analysis
            - Identifying relationships between features
            - Scatter plots (regplot - seaborn), boxplots (x being a categorical feature (labels) and y being numeric (for example the target)), heatmaps
         6. Analyzing outliers and missing values
         7. Correlation Analysis
            - Regplots (seaborn)
            - Correlation matrix
            - Check redundant variables
